While all of the projects may appear to be recently added, I worked on them throughout the year 2024.
In addition, I completed several courses in cybersecurity and have developed a solid foundation in programming with Python and C++. Iâ€™ve built a variety of projects, including obstacle-avoiding cars, line followers, radar/sonar systems, dual-axis control mechanisms, and many others.
Looking ahead, I plan to major in either Machine Learning and AI Development, Data Science, or Electrical/Mechatronic Engineering.
